# Snake AI
Quickly made AI playing snake.

For now it changes the weights between the 6 input neurons and the 3 output neurons (no hidden layers) randomly and takes the parameters of the best snake with the highest score.

The input neurons are : (all booleans)
- Is there food left
- Is there food straight ahead
- Is there food right
- Is there an obstacle left
- Is there an obstacle straight ahead
- Is there an obstacle right

And the output neurons are
- Go left
- Go straight ahead
- Go right

# TODO
- Add a proper genetic algorithm
